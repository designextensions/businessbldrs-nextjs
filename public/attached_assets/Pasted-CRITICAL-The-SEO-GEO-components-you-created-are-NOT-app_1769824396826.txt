CRITICAL: The SEO/GEO components you created are NOT appearing in the HTML source. They're rendering          
  client-side only, which means search engines and AI crawlers cannot see them.                                 
                                                                                                                
  When I right-click → View Page Source on businessbldrs.com, I only see:                                       
  - Basic HTML shell with <div id="root">                                                                       
  - One Organization schema                                                                                     
  - No meta tags, no Article schema, no FAQPage schema, no BreadcrumbList                                       
                                                                                                                
  THE PROBLEM: This is a React SPA. All content renders via JavaScript AFTER page load. Crawlers don't execute  
  JavaScript fully, so they miss everything.                                                                    
                                                                                                                
  ## SOLUTION NEEDED                                                                                            
                                                                                                                
  You need to put the structured data and meta tags directly into the static HTML files, NOT render them via    
  React components.                                                                                             
                                                                                                                
  ### STEP 1: Update index.html with Static Meta Tags                                                           
                                                                                                                
  Find your index.html (root or /public folder) and add these DIRECTLY in the HTML file:

  ### STEP 2: For Blog Posts - Create Static HTML Generation                                                    
                                                                                                                
  Since React components won't work for SEO, you need one of these approaches:                                  
                                                                                                                
  OPTION A (Simplest): Use Replit's static site features                                                        
  - If using Vite, enable SSG (Static Site Generation)                                                          
  - Pre-render pages at build time                                                                              
                                                                                                                
  OPTION B: Create a build script that generates static HTML                                                    
  - For each blog post, generate a static HTML file with the meta tags and schemas baked in                     
                                                                                                                
  OPTION C: Add schemas directly to your data/CMS                                                               
  - Store the Article schema JSON in your blog post data                                                        
  - Inject it server-side or at build time                                                                      
                                                                                                                
  ### STEP 3: Verify the Fix                                                                                    
                                                                                                                
  After making changes:                                                                                         
  1. Deploy the site                                                                                            
  2. Go to https://businessbldrs.com                                                                            
  3. Right-click → View Page Source (NOT Inspect Element)                                                       
  4. Search for "FAQPage" - you should find it                                                                  
  5. Search for "LocalBusiness" - you should find it                                                            
  6. Search for "og:title" - you should find it                                                                 
                                                                                                                
  If these are NOT in View Page Source, the fix didn't work.                                                    
                                                                                                                
  ### STEP 4: Test with Tools                                                                                   
                                                                                                                
  After deploying:

  ## SUMMARY                                                                                                    
                                                                                                                
  The key insight is: ANYTHING you want search engines to see MUST be in the static HTML file, not rendered by  
  JavaScript.                                                                                                   
                                                                                                                
  For a React SPA, this means:                                                                                  
  1. Put global schemas (Organization, LocalBusiness, WebSite, sitewide FAQ) directly in index.html             
  2. Put meta tags directly in index.html                                                                       
  3. For page-specific content (blog posts), you need SSR/SSG or a pre-rendering solution                       
                                                                                                                
  Please make these changes and confirm:                                                                        
  1. What changes you made to index.html                                                                        
  2. Whether the schemas now appear in View Page Source                                                         
  3. If you implemented any SSR/SSG solution for blog posts
