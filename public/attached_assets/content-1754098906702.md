How Breakwater Construction Achieved 22% Growth in Just One Year with Strategic Marketing

## A Case Study on Breakwater Construction’s Partnership with Business Builders

Breakwater Construction, a premier custom pool builder in Northeast Florida, had built its business on word-of-mouth marketing. However, after years of steady revenue with no significant growth, they realized they needed a new strategy to scale. Business Builders (BB) stepped in with a data-driven marketing approach, incorporating video content, automation, and strategic planning to help Breakwater reach more potential customers.

Within just **one year**, Breakwater saw a **22% increase in sales** and a **29% increase in gross revenue**. Beyond the numbers, the partnership provided clarity, efficiency, and a scalable marketing strategy that continues to drive success.

**“The Business Builders team brought ideas to the table that enabled us to share our customer-first culture with potential customers.”**

## The Challenge: A Growth Plateau

For nearly two decades, Breakwater Construction had been building quality custom pools, earning a stellar reputation in Northeast Florida. While word-of-mouth marketing had worked well, the company reached a point where it wasn’t generating enough leads to fuel business growth.

## Key Challenges:

- “We had several years of doing the same amount of revenue and no realized growth.”
- “We are a small team and didn’t have the resources to produce our own marketing content.”
- “Word-of-mouth marketing is always fabulous, but we had hit a roadblock on growth.”

To break through this plateau, Breakwater needed a **consistent stream of high-quality leads** and a **marketing strategy that expanded their reach beyond referrals**.

## What We Did to Help

## A Targeted Marketing Strategy

Business Builders developed a **comprehensive marketing plan** that included **video content, an automated lead-nurturing system, and a user-friendly website tool** to attract and convert potential customers.

## Video Marketing to Reach a Larger Audience

The marketing team worked with Breakwater to **create a series of FAQ videos** that showcased the company’s expertise and customer-first approach.

**“Business Builders came in with their team, helped us organize our vision, and then shot a series of FAQ videos which resulted in a 22% increase in our number of sales and a 29% increase in our gross revenue.”**

## Pool Cost Calculator for Better Lead Qualification

Business Builders Marketing and Development team introduced an **interactive pool pricing calculator** on Breakwater’s website, allowing potential customers to get a rough estimate before requesting a consultation.

In 2024:

- 700+ pool estimates we’re requested
- 79% of all new contacts utilized this tool

**“One of the things is our pool calculator on our website. Potential customers can go and enter in some basics about what they want and in a matter of a minute have a rough estimate for their project.”**

## Automated Lead Nurturing for Higher Conversions

Once someone used the **pool calculator but didn’t request a consultation**, Business Builders set up an **automated email sequence** to stay engaged with the prospect.

10.85% Conversion Rate

**“A series of automated ‘nurture’ emails are sent to them so we remain top of mind—this helps convert tire kickers to qualified leads!”**

## Strategic Guidance & Time Savings

The dedicated Business Builders team, led by Autumn and Natalie, provided **monthly recap meetings** to ensure clear visibility into marketing performance and future strategies.

**“Autumn and Natalie have a 45-minute to 1-hour monthly recap meeting with us. They give us the progress of how we have done and the direction that we are headed next month, then they take over from there and execute—saving us countless hours trying to navigate our marketing on our own.”**

**Their approach went beyond routine updates:**

- **Performance-Driven Execution:** Monthly meetings (45 min to 1 hour) provided clear insights, strategic direction, and detailed follow-through to drive measurable growth.

- **Lead Quality Focus:** Evaluated not just the volume but the quality of leads.

- **System Integration:** Seamlessly connected with Builder Trend for efficient data tracking.
- **Pipeline Insights:** Monitored the sales pipeline closely to identify what converts.
