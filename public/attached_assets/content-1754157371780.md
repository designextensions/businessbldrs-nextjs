## Hines Southeast came to Business Builders to fully redesign 3 of their community websites.

With Hines building and managing several newer communities in Northeast Florida, they needed a company to handle the websites, marketing and more for each neighborhood. Every community is unique, and we wanted to reflect that with the websites we created for Markland and Palencia. Markland was designed to to be a friendly community in St. Johns, FL where neighbors can gather together and enjoy the lifestyle of a larger development on an intimate scale.

This new neighborhood being developed by the prestigious Hines team features homes from six of the best contractors in the area. Hines Southeast came to Business Builders to fully redesign Markland’s website. The goal of the redesign was to increase leads for the new community while showcasing Markland’s luxury atmosphere to potential buyers.

Driving Engagement and Lead Generation Through Strategic Marketing and Custom Web Solutions

Business Builders currently handles several aspects of marketing for Palencia, including social posting, AdWords campaigns, building a custom landing page for their available lots, and more. Our goal is to show off their unique, luxury amenities and give people a hub where they can find out useful information about the community, as well as see advertisements for future events. The landing page we built provides potential buyers with information regarding the lot and a way to get in direct contact with the realty company.

Hines’ latest Jacksonville project is Southside Quarter, a 110-acre mixed-use property in Jacksonville’s ‘Southside’ area. Southside Quarter had a landing page for the upcoming development, but it was very simple and didn’t provide much information. The BB team took the current landing page and built it out into a full website with 7-10 total pages. The purpose of the new website is to generate leads for people interested in living there, establishing a local business there or renting/buying an office. The site features an available lots focuses on showcasing all the different elements of the area: living, working, recreation and shopping.
