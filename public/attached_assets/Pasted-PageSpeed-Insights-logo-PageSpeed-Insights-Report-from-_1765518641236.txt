Accessibility
These checks highlight opportunities to improve the accessibility of your web app. Automatic detection can only detect a subset of issues and does not guarantee the accessibility of your web app, so manual testing is also encouraged.
Names and labels
Buttons do not have an accessible name
Links do not have a discernible name
These are opportunities to improve the semantics of the controls in your application. This may enhance the experience for users of assistive technology, like a screen reader.
ARIA
Elements with role="dialog" or role="alertdialog" do not have accessible names.
These are opportunities to improve the usage of ARIA in your application which may enhance the experience for users of assistive technology, like a screen reader.
Audio and video
<video> elements contain a <track> element with [kind="captions"]
These are opportunities to provide alternative content for audio and video. This may improve the experience for users with hearing or vision impairments.
