JACKSONVILLE, Fla. — For nearly a decade, Jacques Klempf has owned [Cowford Chophouse](https://cowfordchophouse.com/ "https://cowfordchophouse.com/") in downtown Jacksonville, but nothing prepared him for a federal lawsuit over his website.

“When you first heard about the lawsuit, you thought what?,” asked Action News Jax Ben Becker.

“I was shocked.”

Klempf’s website looked harmless enough. But like thousands of businesses nationwide, he was sued for allegedly failing to make it accessible to blind users under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA).

His attorneys delivered blunt advice.

“My attorneys told me, you can fight it, but you’re going to lose because it’s a federal law.”

Rather than battle the case in court, Klempf settled since he had little practical choice- at a cost of roughly $20,000 including attorney’s fees.

### **Thousands of lawsuits filed by a handful of firms**

Action News Jax and its sister stations across the country combed through tens of thousands of federal lawsuits filed over the past four years.

We found more than 15,332 cases alleging visually impaired individuals had difficulty accessing company websites.

In 2025 alone, nearly 4,000 cases were filed. And 90% of them - 3,567 out of 3,948 - were brought by just 16 law firms.

At least 35 Jacksonville businesses have been sued, including:

- European Street Café
- Al’s Pizza
- Dockside Seafood Restaurant

Each lawsuit cites similar claims, alleging inaccessible menus, missing alt-text for images, or difficulty locating basic information like addresses.

In the complaint filed against Cowford Chophouse, the language reads in part:

“The fact that Plaintiff could not communicate with or within the Website left Plaintiff feeling excluded, frustrated, and humiliated, and gave Plaintiff a sense of isolation and segregation…”

### **Exploiting the law and clients?**

South Florida attorney Aleksandra Kravets has filed more than 200 ADA website lawsuits across Florida.

Her client, Jonathan Drummond, who is from Jacksonville, is the named plaintiff in the local cases and dozens more statewide.

“Are you exploiting the law and your client?,” asked Becker.

“I don’t think there is any exploitation going on here.”

She argues online discrimination is widespread.

“Online discrimination faced by blind people is so rampant these days.”

Drummond says his goal is inclusion.

“My main goal is to make everything inclusive for people with disabilities and people who don’t have disability — we should all be on an equal playing ground.”

injuries and damages suffered occurred in the Middle District of Florida. 4.

Plaintiff JONATHAN DRUMMOND is a resident of Volusia County, Florida, is sui juris, and is disabled as defined by the ADA and ADA Amendments

Act of 2008, 42 U.S.C. §12101 (“ADAAA”).

5.

Plaintiff is, and at all relevant times, has been blind and visually disabled in that Plaintiff suffers from retinoblastoma, which is a permanent eye and medical condition that substantially and significantly impairs his vision and limits his ability to see. Plaintiff thus is substantially limited in performing one or more major life activities, including, but not limited to, seeing, accurately visualizing his world, and adequately traversing obstacles. As such, he is a member of a protected class under the ADA, 42 U.S.C. §12102(1)-(2), the regulations implementing the ADA set forth at 28 CFR §§36.101,

et seq

., and 42 U.S.C. §3602(h). Plaintiff further is an advocate of the rights of similarly situated disabled persons and is a

“tester”

for the purposes of asserting his civil rights and monitoring, ensuring, and determining whether places of public accommodation and/or their respective and associated websites are in compliance with the ADA and any other applicable disability laws, regulations, and ordinances. 6.

Based on a 2010 U.S. Census Bureau report, approximately 8.1 million people in the United States are visually impaired, including 2.0 million who are blind. 7.

Because he is blind, Plaintiff cannot use his computer without the

assistance of appropriate and available auxiliary aids, screen reader software, and/or other technology and assistance. Screen reader software translates the visual internet into an auditory equivalent. At a rapid pace, the software reads the content of a webpage to the

user. “The

screen reading software uses auditory cues to allow a visually impaired user to effectively use websites. For example, when using the visual internet, a seeing user learns that a link may be

‘clicked,’

which will bring him to another webpage, through visual cues, such as a change in the color of the text (often text is turned from black to blue). When the sighted user's cursor hovers over the link, it changes from an arrow symbol to a hand. The screen reading software uses auditory -- rather than visual -- cues to relay this same

information. When a sight impaired individual reaches a link that may be ‘clicked on,’ the software reads the link to the use

r, and after reading the text of the link

says the word ‘clickable.’…Through a series of auditory cues read aloud by the

screen reader, the visually impaired user can navigate a website by listening and responding with his

keyboard.”

Andrews v. Blick Art Materials, LLC

, 286 F.Supp.3d 365, 374 (E.D.N.Y.2017). 8.

Defendant is a Florida Limited Liability Company authorized to do business and currently doing business in the State of Florida. The Defendant owns, operates, and/or controls a restaurant offering a fine dining experience with a focus on premium steaks and fresh seafood. The restaurant is located in a historic building, which adds architectural charm to its atmosphere, and it is the restaurant

the Plaintiff intended to patronize in the near future (as early as October and/or early November 2024), located at 101 East Bay Street, Jacksonville, FL 32202. 9.

Plaintiff’s

blindness limits Plaintiff in the performance of major life activities, including sight, and Plaintiff requires assistive technologies, auxiliary aids, and services for effective communication, including communication in connection with his use of a computer. 10.

Plaintiff frequently accesses the internet. Because Plaintiff is blind, to effectively communicate and comprehend information available on the internet and thereby access and comprehend websites, Plaintiff uses commercially available screen reader software to interface with the various websites. 11.

At all times material hereto, Defendant was and still is an organization that owns, operates, and/or controls a restaurant under the name

“

Cowford Chophouse

”

. The

“

Cowford Chophouse

”

restaurant is open to the public. As the owner, operator, and/or controller of this restaurant, Defendant is

defined as a place of “public accommodation” within the meaning of the ADA per

42 U.S.C §12181 and 28 C.F.R. §36.104. 12.

Because Defendant is a restaurant open to the public,

Defendant’s

physical location is a place of public accommodation subject to the requirements of the ADA, 42 U.S.C. §12182, §12181(7), and its implementing regulations, 28 C.F.R. Part 36. 13.

Defendant also owns, controls, maintains, and/or operates an adjunct

### **‘Hyper-Technical Defects’ or legitimate barriers?**

Not everyone agrees with how these cases are being pursued.

“In my experience, I don’t think there’s a website in the universe that’s compliant,” said ADA website litigation attorney Gary Edinger, who has worked dozens of these cases.

“The websites are generally very accessible. It’s just that they have some hyper-technical defects the plaintiffs are able to take advantage of. It doesn’t make the suit frivolous - it makes it unfair and extortionate.”

### **The accessibility widget**

Many businesses, including Cowford, have turned to third-party accessibility tools such as accessiBe.

These widgets promise to make websites ADA compliant with minimal effort.

But in 2025, the Federal Trade Commission reached a $1 million settlement with accessiBe, alleging the company made deceptive claims about its product’s effectiveness and failed to disclose relationships with online reviewers.

The settlement raised further questions for small businesses trying to navigate compliance.

### **Is reform coming?**

For now, federal law does not clearly define precise technical standards for website compliance under the ADA, creating legal gray areas that critics say fuel litigation.

“This law needs to be looked at because it’s being abused,” Klempf said.

Currently, lawmakers in Missouri are considering legislation aimed at curbing what supporters call “predatory” ADA lawsuits targeting small businesses. The proposed bill would require notice and time to cure alleged violations before a lawsuit can proceed.
