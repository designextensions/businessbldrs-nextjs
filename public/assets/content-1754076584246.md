## A Message from Jay

![](https://businessbldrs.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/img-Jay.png)

As a kid, I remember reading an article about a new technology that was coming soon: “the World Wide Web.” It sounded pretty amazing, but I had no idea it would be the story of the next two decades for me.

Business Builders (originally named Design Extensions) started while I was a student at Nease High School in St. Augustine, Florida. I had been playing with websites since the age of 12, but at 17, that hobby became real work. That year, we made a grand total of $5,000. Needless to say, we’ve grown a bit since then — AND we’ve done it every single year for over two decades.

With the right planning, production, and promotion, we can help you do the same.

## Are you ready to forge your future? We’d love to help.

## Testimonials

Our experience with Business Builders and the corresponding maintenance plan has been great. The team is always very prompt to respond and act on the issue and perhaps more importantly , is always very friendly and accomodating during the process. We enjoy working with the team to rebuild the website and monitor to maintain it thereafter. Thank you for all your help!
