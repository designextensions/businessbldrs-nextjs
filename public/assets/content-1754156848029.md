# All Pro Dad

All Pro Dad is a nonprofit organization dedicated to helping fathers love and lead their families well.

## All Pro Dad’s website receives over 10 million visitors per year.

They help dads connect with their kids all over the country by sending out daily emails, putting on big events and hosting monthly father-kids breakfasts. Their site also contains hundreds of blog posts that give dads valuable advice on raising their children, being in relationships and providing for their families.

## WHY THEY CAME TO US

Their old website got the job done for a time, but with their high traffic and rate of growth, it was time for a serious overhaul. Their website was difficult to navigate, had unclear messaging, loaded slowly and functioned poorly on mobile devices. They needed to update their design, layout and messaging, so they went looking for the right team to solve these issues. A popular website with tons of great info like All Pro Dad should be fast, clear and easy to use.
