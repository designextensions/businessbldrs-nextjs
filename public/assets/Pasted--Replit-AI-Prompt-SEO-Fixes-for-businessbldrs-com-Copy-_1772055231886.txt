# Replit AI Prompt — SEO Fixes for businessbldrs.com

## Context

This is the businessbldrs.com website — a React SPA (single-page application) for a St. Augustine marketing agency. The site uses:

- **React** with client-side rendering (empty `<div id="root">` in the HTML source)
- **Custom CSS** (no Tailwind/Bootstrap) with inline critical CSS and `@font-face` for Inter and Playfair Display
- **Deferred script loading** for Google Analytics (G-B2QFCHPQTR) and seoplatform.io
- **JSON-LD structured data** already in place (Organization, LocalBusiness, FAQPage, ItemList, WebSite schemas)
- **564 URLs** in the sitemap across service pages, 480+ blog articles, case studies, location pages, and tools

The site has a serious SEO problem: **search engines cannot see the page content** because it's a client-side React SPA. The `<div id="root">` is empty in the HTML source — all content loads via JavaScript. Google can render JavaScript, but it's slower and less reliable than server-rendered HTML. Additionally, most pages are missing meta descriptions, and several on-page SEO elements need fixing.

## Task: Fix SEO issues in priority order

Please make the following changes. Work through them in order — each one is numbered by priority.

---

### 1. CRITICAL — Add pre-rendering or SSR so search engines can see page content

The `<div id="root">` is completely empty in the server response. Search engines get a blank page until JavaScript executes. This is the #1 issue.

**Option A (Recommended — easiest in Replit):** Add a pre-rendering solution. If you're using Vite, install `vite-plugin-ssr` or switch to a `react-snap` post-build step that generates static HTML for each route. If using Create React App or a custom setup, add `react-snap` to the build process:

```json
// In package.json, add:
"scripts": {
  "postbuild": "react-snap"
},
"reactSnap": {
  "source": "build",
  "minifyHtml": { "collapseWhitespace": false }
}
```

**Option B:** If the project can be migrated to Next.js or Remix, that would be ideal long-term, but is a larger effort.

**Option C (Minimum viable):** At a minimum, add a server-side template that injects critical content (title, meta description, H1, first paragraph) into the HTML shell for each route BEFORE React hydrates. This ensures crawlers see real content.

Whatever approach you choose, verify that `curl https://businessbldrs.com/seo` returns actual page content in the HTML body, not just `<div id="root"></div>`.

### 2. HIGH — Add unique meta descriptions to all key pages

Currently, most pages have NO meta description tag in the HTML. Add one to every page. Here are the exact descriptions to use for key pages:

**In whatever component or file manages the `<head>` (likely a Helmet component, a Layout component, or individual page components), add `<meta name="description">` tags:**

```

```

If you're using `react-helmet`, `react-helmet-async`, or a custom `<Head>` component, add these in each page component. If there's a centralized SEO config or route-based meta system, update that instead.

---

### 3. HIGH — Ensure every page has exactly one H1 tag

Check every page component. Each page should have exactly ONE `<h1>` tag that contains the primary keyword for that page. Examples:

- Homepage: `<h1>St. Augustine Marketing Agency</h1>`
- /seo-services: `<h1>SEO Services in St. Augustine & Jacksonville</h1>`
- /website-design: `<h1>Website Design & Development</h1>`
- /hubspot-implementation: `<h1>HubSpot Implementation & Support</h1>`

Do NOT use H1 for decorative text or taglines. The H1 should be the main keyword-rich heading.

---

### 4. HIGH — Add Open Graph and Twitter Card meta tags

Add these to every page (dynamically, using the same system as meta descriptions):

```html
<meta property="og:title" content="{Page Title}">
<meta property="og:description" content="{Same as meta description}">
<meta property="og:type" content="website">
<meta property="og:url" content="https://businessbldrs.com{path}">
<meta property="og:image" content="https://businessbldrs.com/og-image.jpg">
<meta property="og:site_name" content="Business Builders">
<meta name="twitter:card" content="summary_large_image">
<meta name="twitter:title" content="{Page Title}">
<meta name="twitter:description" content="{Same as meta description}">
```

Create a reusable `<SEO>` component if one doesn't exist:

```jsx
// components/SEO.jsx
import { Helmet } from 'react-helmet-async';

export default function SEO({ title, description, path, image }) {
  const siteUrl = 'https://businessbldrs.com';
  const fullUrl = `${siteUrl}${path}`;
  const ogImage = image || `${siteUrl}/og-image.jpg`;

  return (
    <Helmet>
      <title>{title} | Business Builders</title>
      <meta name="description" content={description} />
      <link rel="canonical" href={fullUrl} />
      <meta property="og:title" content={title} />
      <meta property="og:description" content={description} />
      <meta property="og:type" content="website" />
      <meta property="og:url" content={fullUrl} />
      <meta property="og:image" content={ogImage} />
      <meta property="og:site_name" content="Business Builders" />
      <meta name="twitter:card" content="summary_large_image" />
      <meta name="twitter:title" content={title} />
      <meta name="twitter:description" content={description} />
    </Helmet>
  );
}
```

Then use it in each page:
```jsx
<SEO
  title="SEO Services in St. Augustine & Jacksonville"
  description="Professional SEO services in St. Augustine & Jacksonville FL. Keyword research, on-page optimization, local SEO & analytics."
  path="/seo-services"
/>
```

---

### 5. MEDIUM — Fix canonical URL consistency (www vs non-www)

The site may respond on both `businessbldrs.com` and `www.businessbldrs.com`. Add canonical tags to every page pointing to the non-www version:

```html
<link rel="canonical" href="https://businessbldrs.com{path}" />
```

This is handled by the `<SEO>` component above. Also ensure the server redirects `www.businessbldrs.com` to `businessbldrs.com` with a 301 redirect.

---

### 6. MEDIUM — Add alt text to all images

Search the codebase for all `<img` tags and any image components. Every image must have a descriptive `alt` attribute. Examples:

- Logo: `alt="Business Builders - St. Augustine Marketing Agency"`
- Team photos: `alt="John Smith - Marketing Strategist at Business Builders"`
- Portfolio images: `alt="Website redesign for Breakwater Construction"`
- Icons/decorative: `alt=""` (empty alt for purely decorative images)

Do a global search for `<img` and `src=` to find all images, then add appropriate alt text.

---

### 7. MEDIUM — Add internal links from blog posts to service pages

In the blog article template/component (the one rendering the 480+ articles at `/resources/articles/[slug]`), add a contextual call-to-action section at the bottom of each article that links to relevant service pages. Example:

```jsx
// At the bottom of each blog post
<div className="related-services">
  <h3>Ready to grow your business?</h3>
  <p>
    Learn more about our <a href="/seo-services">SEO services</a>,
    <a href="/website-design">website design</a>, and
    <a href="/marketing-services">full-service marketing</a>.
  </p>
</div>
```

Ideally, make the linked services dynamic based on article tags/categories.

---

### 8. LOW — Self-host Google Fonts for speed

The site currently loads Inter and Playfair Display from Google Fonts via external requests. Download the font files and serve them locally to eliminate the external request and improve page load:

1. Download the WOFF2 files for Inter (400, 500, 600, 700) and Playfair Display (700)
2. Put them in `/public/fonts/` or your static assets folder
3. Update the `@font-face` declarations to point to local paths
4. Add `font-display: swap` to each `@font-face` rule
5. Remove the Google Fonts `<link>` tags from the HTML head

---

### 9. LOW — Create new location pages

Create the following new routes and pages. Each should follow the same template as `/st-augustine` and `/jacksonville` but with location-specific content:

- `/palm-coast` — "Marketing Agency in Palm Coast, FL"
- `/ponte-vedra` — "Marketing Agency in Ponte Vedra Beach, FL"
- `/orange-park` — "Marketing Agency in Orange Park, FL"
- `/gainesville` — "Marketing Agency in Gainesville, FL"
- `/daytona-beach` — "Marketing Agency in Daytona Beach, FL"

Each page should include: H1 with location + "marketing agency", meta description with location, a brief intro about serving that area, list of services available, link to request a quote, and LocalBusiness schema markup with the appropriate service area.

Add these new URLs to the sitemap.
