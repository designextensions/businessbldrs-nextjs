  ## 5. FIX IMAGE ALT TEXT                                                                                          
                                                                                                                    
  Find the logo image and add proper alt text:                                                                      
  <img src="/logo.png" alt="Business Builders Marketing Agency Logo" />                                             
                                                                                                                    
  For all other images, ensure they have descriptive alt text that explains what the image shows.                   
                                                                                                                    
  ## 6. ENSURE SERVER-SIDE RENDERING                                                                                
                                                                                                                    
  Make sure all meta tags, title tags, H1 tags, and structured data are rendered server-side (not client-side only).
   This is critical for SEO. If using React:                                                                        
  - Use Next.js with its Head component, or                                                                         
  - Implement SSR/SSG, or                                                                                           
  - Use react-helmet-async with proper server rendering                                                             
                                                                                                                    
  The HTML source (View Page Source) must show all meta tags without JavaScript execution.
