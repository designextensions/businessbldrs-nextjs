## "Chief Visionary"

I have always loved technology. From a young age, my hands were often found glued to a keyboard. My venture into the design and Internet world started around age 12 when my parents bought their first family Mac — it was an Apple Performa 575 (for all you geeks out there). I started designing and learning about this great new thing that was coming: “the World Wide Web.”

After working at a technology firm in Jacksonville from the age of 15-17, a friend (Justin Filoseta) and I started Design Extensions in June of 1999. Since that time, DE has taken on a life of its own, pulling in clients from dozens of industries all across the United States. In 2021, we renamed the agency to Business Builders. While originally I managed all aspects of the company, I’m now focused on speaking engagements and caring well for our team. When not working on the business, I can usually be found spending time with my wife, Claire, and our five children Hayden, Oliver, Lincoln, Eden, and Eva — and our English Bulldog Darby.

## Outside of the office I...

am usually busy with my wife and our 5 kids (and bulldog).
