## What is the StoryBrand Framework?

Every good story since the beginning of time follows this framework, including original folklores, books, and movies, like Star Wars, Frozen, and The Hunger Games.

Here’s how it works:

- A character steps into the story (that’s your customer).
- They have a problem (they need help solving it).
- They meet a guide (that’s you!).
- Their guide gives them a plan (how to solve their problem).
- That plan calls them to action (to buy from you to solve their problem).

## And then?

Success! If you’ve followed the StoryBrand Framework, you have met your customer’s needs (ideally, you surpassed them!) and they love your business, or your brand. On the flip side, if your customer does not buy from you to solve their problem, that leads to failure, and that failure can look different depending on what your customer needed in the first place.

There’s a good reason why this framework has gained traction and popularity while garnering major results. It allows businesses to shift the focus from their own accomplishments to how they can actually help the customer, turning the customer into the heroic character and the business into the helpful guide. In fact, this framework is so good that we call it our marketing strategy secret weapon.

## Character

Your character, or customer, is here because they want something. What do they want?

## To Get a Character Transformation

The end result is not the same as the beginning result, especially when you’ve helped your customer experience success. This is a “From… to” statement that should change your customer’s life — for the better!

## Problem

There are three parts to the problem.

External: The actual problem.

Internal: How the actual problem makes them feel.

Philosophical: A belief statement about the actual problem, usually starting with “It’s just plain wrong that…” or “I deserve…”

## Meets a Guide

The guide, or business, enters the story to help the customer solve their problem through…

Empathy: “I understand…”

Authority: “I have helped people just like you for more than 10 years…”

## Who Gives Them a Plan

The guide gives the character a clear vision for how to solve their problem.

Process: Our brains like three steps, so a 1-2-3 step process is always best.

Agreement: An agreement is what you, as a business, promise to your customer.

## Calls Them to Action

It’s not enough to give your customer a plan — you have to give them a clear next step.

Direct: When a prospective customer is ready to make a move: “Call today!”

Transitional: When a prospective customer is interested but not quite ready to make a move: “Download 5 Ways We Can Help!”

## And Helps Avoid Failure

The character, or customer, will be unhappy and experience failure after not fulfilling their want through your business.

## Which Leads to Success

The character, or customer, will be happy and experience success after fulfilling their want through your business.

## How Does StoryBrand Apply to Marketing?

Nice people, pretty designs, and awesome products and services are great, but clear messaging is the foundation of everything.

If you want your marketing to be successful, then it rests on your business’s ability to clarify its messaging. When you confuse, you lose. That’s why following the StoryBrand Framework is so important. It eliminates confusion and brings clarity to who your business is, what it offers, and how it can help prospective customers achieve success.

## Eliminate confusion.

People have short attention spans, busy lifestyles, and minimal patience. They don’t have the time or desire to figure out what you’re saying, what you offer, and how they can get it. No matter what industry you’re in, you have a lot of competition, and there’s no reason for prospective customers to waste their time on your business if you’re not clear, right away, about how you can help them.

## Connect with customers.

Ever known a business that clearly didn’t care about its customers? Like instead of connecting with customers as individuals and actual people, they were treated more like a mere product on an assembly line, with little value? StoryBrand lets you show your customer that you truly understand their problem and want to help. Empathy is essential because it helps customers connect with your brand or business. Think about your favorite businesses, ones that you’re happy to recommend to others. What do they do to make you love them so much? Do that for your customers.

## Grow your business.

When you need a product or service, you want the best. Right? Of course you do! And you deserve it. Nobody wants to work with a business that delivers subpar products and services. Just like you, your customers want to work with businesses that make them feel confident that they have the help they need to solve their specific problem. When prospective customers feel confident that you can successfully solve their problem, it helps convert them into customers — and that’s a fact.

## How Working With A StoryBrand Certified Agency Can Help

**It’s always best to work with an expert.**

For example, when you need your car fixed, you’d much rather have an experienced and knowledgeable mechanic make the repair, not your second cousin who just so happens to like cars.

**_Your marketing isn’t any different._**

Business Builders is a StoryBrand Certified Agency and working with a certified agency can have real benefits for your business.

## Clarify Your Messaging

By following the StoryBrand Framework, you’ll have a clear path to creating a message that will actually compel your customer (or prospective customer in this case) to take action. This means more money and more growth for your business!

## Help From Start to Finish

The best part about working with a StoryBrand Certified Agency is that you don’t have to do anything yourself except listen, learn, provide input, and look forward to amazing results. We’ve got a full team that can take your BrandScript and translate it into marketing materials that get you major results.

## An Outsider’s Perspective

Just like with anything in life, it can be incredibly helpful to have a third party examine your situation. That’s what our team will do, as industry experts. An outsider looking in has a huge advantage, as they can offer a fresh perspective on your business to help you see problems that you might not notice otherwise.
